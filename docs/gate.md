CommonJS module providing simple mathematical question as parental gate for kids apps.

* [example](../app/controllers/gate.js)
* [source](../app/lib/gate.js)

## Why?
With iOS7 Apple introduced a new [kids-category](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGrouping?cc=us&id=136474) in their App Store. To be listed, apps have to meet some additional [guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html), including *"Apps primarily intended for use by kids under 13 must get parental permission or use a parental gate before allowing the user to link out of the app or engage in commerce."*
